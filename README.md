# AVAF
We propose an automatic video analysis framework for exposure region recognition in X-ray examination. In this work, we have constructed a large dataset including body keypoint and body Bbox annotation images. Currently, we are further expanding the categories of the two annotations and transforming data format so that it can be accessed more conveniently and quickly. Soon, We will open access for the whole dataset. 
# Dataset
Before the dataset expansion is complete, the dataset will not open access and if you need the dataset of current version for academic research, please send us a email for getting it.
